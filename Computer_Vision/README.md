# 01. Experiments Using Images

## Super Resolution
Ever thought about improving those poor-quality photos that you really like? This is possible with the Faster Super Resolution neural network, a network with an architecture capable of enhancing the resolution of any image.

About: In this experiment, we will train a convolutional neural network model to reconstruct images, from low resolution to high resolution. You can train the model from the FRSCNN_DIV2K_AISTUDIO.ipynb, it takes around 24 hours to train. Or you can just use the pre trained model FRSCNN_300_epochs.pt to infer in an image.
