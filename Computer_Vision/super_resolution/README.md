 ## 1. Project Setup on AI Studio
 ---
 ### Workspace
 For this experiment, **we highly recommend yo to create a custom workspace on AI Studio using the Deep Learning GPU-based image**. 

 For extra libraries and specific versions, you can download our [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) and direclty upload it on the Add Python Libraries field.
 
 For the memory configurations, you should set **at least 4GB for GPU RAM and 2 for GPU VRAM.**

 ### Accessing Jupyter Notebooks
 There are two ways for you to access the notebooks.
 #### First: By cloning the repo

Go to [Catalogue repository](https://github.azc.ext.hp.com/phoenix/ds-experiments/tree/draft/demo_catalogue) and copy the HTTPS URL. Next, go to your Project > Setup & Documentation > GitHub Repository and hit the CLONE GIT REPOSITORY button. Paste the URL, choose a local folder for the repository to be located and add it to the project.

 #### Second: By downloading the files from One Drive
You can access the notebook directly from this [link](https://hp-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/p/andressa_da-rosa/EZV0SHWe5XdAvws4Wkw-IuUB3tx0hH1gV76W8tvS4T4y6w?e=a8aSVP).

 ### How to access the trained model
 #### Download from One Drive
You can access the pre-trained model directly from this [link](https://hp-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/p/andressa_da-rosa/EaU805oLqcBKvYWwd8MMq3EBj2hf2gVtOfBt4QwUC6yE2A?e=9d5oIq). 

 ## 2. How to use the experiment
 ---
    ⭐ Watch the demonstration video: 
 This experiment consists of the notebook [FSRCNN_DIV2K_AISTUDIO.ipynb ](FSRCNN_DIV2K_AISTUDIO.ipynb). In it, you can analyze and explore the dataset, preprocess the images, train, and perform local inference with the pre-trained model. It's important to note that this training takes a considerable amount of time to complete. Therefore, we do not recommend running the training during a demonstration but rather using the already trained model.
