## Experiment details

### **RNN with Time Series TF** 

Experiment to forecast sales using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks within the TensorFlow and Keras frameworks, employing time series data processing and model training techniques.

- **Required resources** 

    Optimal for execution on GPU due to LSTM's computational demands, but can also run on CPU. Requires moderate to high memory space depending on the dataset size and model complexity.

- **Dataset details** 

    The dataset is a CSV file composed by 326 rows and 2 columns. The file has no more than 5.18 KB.

### **A tale of two cities analyzing trends** 

This experiment analyzes and forecasts mobility and COVID-19 case trends in New York and London. Using advanced statistical models like Vector Autoregression (VAR) and Exponential Smoothing, the study integrates data on mobility changes from sources like Googleâ€™s COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports with public health data on COVID-19 cases.

- **Required resources** 

    The study can be performed on both CPU and GPU. While it is computationally intensive due to the complexity of VAR models and large datasets.

- **Dataset details** 

    The datasets include:
    - New York Mobility Data: 53,803 rows and 15 columns detailing trends at locations like parks, transit stations, and retail areas.
    - London Mobility Data: 29,649 rows and 15 columns capturing similar mobility trends as the New York dataset.
    - New York COVID-19 Case Data: 856 rows and 64 columns with detailed public health data including daily cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.
    - London COVID-19 Case Data: 839 rows and 22 columns providing comprehensive health metrics similar to the New York health data.
