## Experiment details

### **Digits Classification (MNIST) with Keras** 

Convolutional Neural Network for classifying handwritten numeric digit images.

- **Required resources** 

    It can be run on the CPU, but we strongly recommend running it on a GPU to accelerate training.

- **Dataset details** 

    The MNIST dataset is comprised of 70,000 handwritten numeric digit images and their respective labels. In this experiment we use the built-in version from the `keras.datasets` which has no mre than 63.4 MB.
