## Experiment details

### **RNN for text generation** 

Recurrent Neural Network for text generation.

- **Required resources** 

    We strongly recommend running it on a GPU to accelerate training.

- **Dataset details** 

    The dataset is a TXT from a Shakespeare book with no more than 5.19 MB.


### **Q&A System with BERT** 

Pre-trained BERT model for building a Q&A model.

- **Required resources** 

    Needs to be run on the GPU. One single epoch can take about 7 hours.

- **Dataset details** 

    Built-in dataset from `datasets` Hugging Face module in a JSON format.
