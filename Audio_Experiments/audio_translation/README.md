 ## 1. Project Setup on AI Studio
 ---
 ### Workspace
 For this experiment, **we highly recommend yo to create a custom workspace on AI Studio using the NeMo image**. 

 For extra libraries and specific versions, you can download our [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) and direclty upload it on the Add Python Libraries field.
 
 For the memory configurations, you should set **at least 4GB for GPU RAM and 2 for GPU VRAM.**

 ### Accessing Jupyter Notebooks
 There are two ways for you to access the notebooks.
 #### First: By cloning the repo

Go to [Catalogue repository](https://github.azc.ext.hp.com/phoenix/ds-experiments/tree/draft/demo_catalogue) and copy the HTTPS URL. Next, go to your Project > Setup & Documentation > GitHub Repository and hit the CLONE GIT REPOSITORY button. Paste the URL, choose a local folder for the repository to be located and add it to the project.

 ## 2. How to use the experiment
 ---
    ⭐ Watch the demonstration video: 
 This experiment consists of the notebook [AudioTranslationSample.ipynb ](AudioTranslationSample.ipynb). In it, you can analyze and explore the data and perform local inference with the pre-trained model.This is a recommended notebook to run during a demonstration.
