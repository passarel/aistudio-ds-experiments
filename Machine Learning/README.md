# **Machine Learning**
---
> Machine Learning experiments that use the main frameworks in the field such as `sklearn`, `xgboost`, `statsmodel`, `suprise` and more.

----------

## Technical details
- Low to medium memory and storage space. 
- Most of the experiments run in the CPU.

## Tasks

**Classification**: Assigning predefined labels or categories to input data points based on their features. The goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify new, unseen data into the correct categories. This task is commonly used in applications like spam email detection, image recognition, and medical diagnosis.

**Clustering**: Grouping data points into clusters or subsets based on their inherent similarities or patterns. The aim is to uncover hidden structures within the data without predefined categories. Clustering finds applications in diverse domains, including customer segmentation in marketing, document grouping in natural language processing, and image compression in computer vision.

**Forecasting:** Predicting future events or trends using historical data and models, aiming to make informed decisions and preparations. Common objectives include financial predictions, weather forecasting, and demand planning.

---
**Recommender systems:** Assign relevant recommendations to users based on their preferences and behavior through various methods and algorithms.

---
**Regression**: Statistical analysis technique used to model and quantify the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable. Its primary objective is to make predictions and understand the impact of independent variables on the target variable. Common applications include sales forecasting, price prediction, and trend analysis.
